Developing Data Products Project repo

This application has been created as a course project for the  Developing Data Products course, of June 2015. 

The application is basically a tool for viewing graphically some statistical distributions. There is control over the characteristic parameters of each distribution. The distributions are the Beta distribution, the Binomial distribution, the Cauchy distribution, the Chi-squared distribution, the Exponential distribution, the F distribution, the Gamma distribution, the Geometric distribution, the Hypergeometric distribution, the Log-normal distribution, the Multinomial distribution, the Negative binomial distribution, the Normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, the Student's t distribution, the Uniform distribution, and the Weibull distribution.
