Developing Data Products Course Project: An app for the graphical display of common statistical distributions

Motivation
========================================================
<small>
The application was created as part of the Course Project for Coursera's Developing Data Products Course. For trying it out go [here](https://nazarian2.shinyapps.io/DDPProject). The github repo with the code can be found [here](https://nazarian2.shinyapps.io/DDPProject)

The author found that he lacks some intuition about statistical distributions. Hence he decided to create an app to provide graphical intuition about some common statistical distributions, and how a change in the characteristic parameters of that distribution affect the shape of it. 

The statistical distributions supported are the Beta distribution, the Binomial distribution, the Cauchy distribution, the Chi-squared distribution, the Exponential distribution, the F distribution, the Gamma distribution, the Geometric distribution, the Hypergeometric distribution, the Log-normal distribution, the Multinomial distribution, the Negative binomial distribution, the Normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, the Student's t distribution, the Uniform distribution, and the Weibull distribution.

Some code
========================================================


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
     speed           dist       
 Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
 Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
 Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
 Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  
```


A view of the App: an Example
========================================================


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
     speed           dist       
 Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
 Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
 Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
 Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  
```


Final Remarks
========================================================

The application provides useful insights about common statistical distributions and how the parameters change the shape of the curves.
